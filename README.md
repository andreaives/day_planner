###### Technologies Used
The main tech used was JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This code was created on Visual Studio and renders were checked on Google Chrome. 


## Problems I faced
Somehow my relative path on my folders were corrupted so I had to create a new repo, folder, and files which was pretty frustrating. The loop also took me a long time to get through and a few extra eyes.
